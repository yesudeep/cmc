Tipfy is a cute little Python framework for App Engine which follows the basic
concepts of `web.py <http://webpy.org/>`_ and `webapp <http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/webapp/>`_.
It is built on top of Werkzeug's WSGI utilities and uses Jinja2 for the
template engine and Babel for internationalization.

Quick howto
===========
1. Add the contents of the /source directory to your App Engine project dir.

2. Start the development server pointing to your App Engine project dir:

     $ dev_appserver.py /path/to/my/app

3. Follow the "Hello, World!" mini-tutorial in the project's page:
