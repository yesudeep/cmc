      <h2>So, What's the Recipe for the Perfect Cutting Masala Chai?</h2>
      <p>Honestly, there isn't one&mdash;each person has their own unique blend, but here goes: The story should quench the readers thirst for inspiration, motivation; it should invigorate, be refreshing, offer nourishment, or be soothing and aromatic or strong and heady. There should be a positive message&mdash;a life lesson, an inspiring take away, a lighter side to a grave problem or situation.</p>
      <p>True stories. No fiction. <strong>Length:</strong> 300 to 900 words. <strong>Stories: </strong> Of personal triumph over myriad obstacles; of survival, of winners, fighters, people who believed in their own dreams and fought with determination to achieve them or are still fighting&mdash;in career, business, health, relationships, love.</p>
      <p>Of acts of greatness&mdash;whatever it maybe: sacrifice, love, bravery, kindness, selflessness, patriotism, compassion, generosity, integrity, undying faith in oneself, in god, hard work and determination in the face of adversity, Of social entrepreneurs, rural innovators who change the game for others despite their own problems.</p>
      <p>NO discussion or rambles or personal viewpoints on Politics, government policy, religion or any controversial issues. NO personal biographies or essays, research reports or thesis or book manuscripts / proposals.</p>
      <h2>Cash Payment:</h2>
      <p>None to be made to you. None needed from you.</p><p> Your story definitely means a lot to you&mdash;it is invaluable and cannot be bought for money.
