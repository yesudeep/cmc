        <li>The User hereby agrees to and does hereby waives all moral rights with respect to the work developed or produced, including without limitation any and all rights of identification of authorship and all rights of approval, restriction, or limitation on use or subsequent modifications.

Without prejudice to the above, it is agreed that acceptance to these terms shall operate as a perpetual, world wide written assignment in favor of <a href="/">{{ APPLICATION_NAME }}</a> of any right, title or interest that the User may have in respect of such intellectual property.
        </li>
        <li>The User agrees to and hereby does assign to <a href="/">{{ APPLICATION_NAME }}</a> all rights, title and interest in each and every copyright, work of authorship, trademark, service mark, programming idea, invention, patent, trade secrets or any other intellectual property rights created or developed, discovered, learned or reduced to practice, whether alone or with others.
        </li>
        <li>The User shall not in any manner whatsoever claim any royalty and/or any other consideration in any manner whatsoever in any part of the publication of <a href="/">{{ APPLICATION_NAME }}</a>, whether his/her/its story is used or not in full and/or part and the User hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives and/or relinquishes his /her/its right and/or interest and/or title in the same.
        </li>
        <li>The story and/or material so posted by the User shall not contain any false representations and/or facts and that the User shall take all reasonable and diligent steps to find out about the veracity of the story and/or material so posted prior to posting the same.
        </li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li><p>The User agrees to inform <a href="/">{{ APPLICATION_NAME }}</a> in writing of any apparent conflict between the User's story and/or material and/or work for <a href="/">{{ APPLICATION_NAME }}</a> and:</p>
        <ol class="lower-alpha">
          <li>any obligations the User may have to preserve the confidentiality of another's proprietary information or materials, or</li>
          <li>any rights the User claims to any copyrights, work of authorship, or other ideas, inventions, concepts, or other proprietary information or materials, before posting the story and/or material.</li>
          </ol>
<p>
          Otherwise, <a href="/">{{ APPLICATION_NAME }}</a> may conclude that no such conflict exists and the User agrees thereafter to make no such claim against the <a href="/">{{ APPLICATION_NAME }}</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            The User agrees that the conditions in this Terms of Use and the Confidential Material disclosed pursuant to acceptance thereto are of a special, unique, and extraordinary character and that an impending or existing violation of any provision of this Terms of Use would cause <a href="/">{{ APPLICATION_NAME }}</a> irreparable injury for which it would have no adequate remedy at law, and further agrees that <a href="/">{{ APPLICATION_NAME }}</a> shall be entitled to obtain immediately injunctive relief prohibiting such violation, in addition to any other rights and remedies available to it at law or in equity. The User understands and agrees that monetary damages will not be sufficient to avoid or compensate for the unauthorized use or disclosure of any of <a href="/">{{ APPLICATION_NAME }}</a> Confidential Information. Accordingly, the User, understands and agrees that in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Terms of Use, <a href="/">{{ APPLICATION_NAME }}</a>, in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity it may have, shall be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance. The User hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless <a href="/">{{ APPLICATION_NAME }}</a> from any damages, loss, cost or liability (including legal and expert witnesses' fees and the cost of enforcing this indemnity) arising out of or resulting from any unauthorized use or disclosure by the User of the Confidential Information and/or breach and/or violation of any of the terms and conditions of this Terms of Use, unless and to the extent prohibited by law.
        </li>
        <li>
            It is explicitly clarified and understood and agreed by the User that it may be extremely difficult to measure in money the damage to <a href="/">{{ APPLICATION_NAME }}</a> of any failure on the part of the User to comply with this Terms of Use and that the restrictions and obligations under this Terms of Use are material, and that, in the event of any failure on the part of the User in complying with the terms hereunder, <a href="/">{{ APPLICATION_NAME }}</a> and its assigns could suffer irreparable harm and significant injury, which may not be capable of being compensated in terms of money. The User therefore agrees, that should <a href="/">{{ APPLICATION_NAME }}</a> find the User in breach of any of the provisions of this Terms of Use, <a href="/">{{ APPLICATION_NAME }}</a> shall be entitled to seek the issuance of an injunction or other restraining order or to the enforcement of other equitable remedies against the User to compel performance of the terms of this Terms of Use without the necessity of showing or proving it has sustained any actual damage. The User further understands that willful disclosure of <a href="/">{{ APPLICATION_NAME }}</a>'s Confidential Information amounts to an offense under Chapter XVII, Section 405 to 409 of the Indian Penal Code (which deal with Criminal Breach of Trust) and other international rules and laws and could lead to imprisonment. This will be in addition to and without prejudice to any other legal rights and remedies available to <a href="/">{{ APPLICATION_NAME }}</a> in law or equity.
        </li>
        <li>
            No remedy conferred on <a href="/">{{ APPLICATION_NAME }}</a> by any of the specific provisions of this Terms of Use is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, and each and every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise. The election of one or more remedies by <a href="/">{{ APPLICATION_NAME }}</a> shall not constitute a waiver of the right to pursue other available remedies.
        </li>
        <li>
            The User hereto warrants and represents that he/she/it has carefully read this Terms of Use, that he/she/it executes this Terms of Use with full knowledge of the contents of this Terms of Use, the legal consequences thereof, and any and all rights which the User may have with respect to <a href="/">{{ APPLICATION_NAME }}</a>, that he/her/it has had the opportunity to receive independent legal advice with respect to the matters set forth in this Terms of Use and with respect to the rights and asserted rights arising out of such matters, and that he/she/it is entering into this Terms of Use of his/her/its own free will.
        </li>
        <li>
            The User agrees that the laws of India shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Terms of Use and any litigation of disputes under this Terms of Use shall be conducted in courts located in India.
        </li>
        <li>
            If any provision of this Terms of Use is held to be void, invalid, or inoperative, such event shall not affect any other provisions herein, which shall continue and remain in full force and effect as though such void, invalid, or inoperative provision had not been a part hereof.
        </li>
        <li>
            Any and all disputes, controversies and conflicts (hereinafter referred to as "Disputes") arising out of this Terms of Use between the Parties hereto or arising out of or relating to or in connection with this Terms of Use and the performance or non-performance of the rights and obligations set forth herein or the termination or validity or interpretation or implementation or alleged breach of any provision of this Terms of Use shall be referred for arbitration in terms of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 or any modifications and/or re-enactments thereof. Prior to submitting the Disputes to arbitration the parties hereto shall mutually resolve to settle the Disputes through mutual negotiation and discussions. In the event that the said Disputes are not settled within 15 days of the arising of the Disputes, the same shall finally be settled and determined by arbitration to be conducted by a sole arbitrator in accordance with the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The place of arbitration shall be Mumbai and the language used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English. The sole arbitrator shall be decided and appointed by <a href="/">{{ APPLICATION_NAME }}</a>, which appointment shall not be objected to or challenged by the User in any manner whatsoever, including challenging the award of the arbitrator on this ground. The arbitral award and decision by the arbitrator shall be in writing and shall be final and binding and shall be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. None of the Parties shall be entitled to commence or maintain any action in a court of law upon any Dispute arising out of or relating to or in connection with this Agreement, except for the enforcement of an arbitral award or as permitted under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Pending the submission to arbitration and thereafter, till the tribunal renders its award or decision, the Parties shall, except in the event that relief is granted under the Act, continue to perform their obligations under this Terms of Use.
